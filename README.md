# Kamisado
PC version of the board game Kamisado, where the player plays against the computer. The current version does not include the advanced rules using the dragon teeth. The game only runs on Windows and requires at least .NET Framework 3.5 (I know... it was developed in 2011).

Version 1.0.0 is out now, download it here: https://github.com/TheAsteroid/kamisado/releases

Players can start as either Black or Gold, where Black always has the first move.

Difficulty can be set to a number of levels, indicating how far the computer player looks ahead

Not looking ahead enough or losing your focus? The computer won't let you win that easily...
